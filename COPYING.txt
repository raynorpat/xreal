XreaL License
=============
XreaL is licensed in two broadly separate sections: the code and the media.


XreaL Code License
==================
The code is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. This license is
contained in full in the file named GPL.txt. Please be aware of the exceptions to
this license as listed below.


XreaL Media License
===================
The media is licensed under All Rights Reserved with a few exceptions.
Each file has Subversion properties that tell you the license and who holds the copyright.

To keep track of all artists and contributors, we use Subversion Properties for each file.
If you are not familiar with Subversion Properties then have a look at the
SVN Manual Chapter 7. Advanced topics - Properties.

These properties are:

svn:copyright = lists all authors who were involved
svn:license = contains what license is this asset set under
svn:source = optional information where this file was grabbed from

Properties can be listed via the svn proplist command:

$ svn proplist -R -v base/sound/
Properties on 'base/sound/misc/menu1.wav':
  svn:source : http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/samplesViewSingle.php?id=24782
  svn:license : Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0
  svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
  svn:copyright : (c) 2006 young_daddy


See MEDIA.txt for a listing of the individual copyrights and licenses of media files in the XreaL/base/ dir.

JPEG library

Copyright (C) 1991-1995, Thomas G. Lane

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
